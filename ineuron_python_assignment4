Ans- 
spam =[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
spam.insert(3, "Hello")
spam

Ans- Hello

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
Ans- 10

5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
Ans- [2, 4]

Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat',True] for the next three questions.
6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
Ans- 1

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
Ans- [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?
Ans- [3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
Ans- Concatenation is "+" and  Replication is "*".

10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
Ans- append() inserts a value to the list at the end but with insert() there is a control to insert values in whatever position we want to.

11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
Ans- pop() and remove()

12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
Ans- Both are sequential and are iterable.

13. What is the difference between tuples and lists?
Ans- Tuples are immutable while lists are mutable.

14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
Ans-  (42,) -> We should put a comma

15. How do you get a list values tuple form? How do you get a tuple values list form?
Ans- list1= tuple(list1) and tuple1= list(tuple1)

16. Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they
contain?
Ans- They contain reference to list values.

17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
Ans- copy() creates reference to the original object ie if we change copied object we change the original object as well.
On the other hand, deepcopy() makes new object and does real copying of the main object.
